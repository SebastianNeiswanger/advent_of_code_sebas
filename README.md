# advent_of_code
 
Author: Sebastian Neiswanger

All of the problems are copies from adventofcode.com. I wanted an easy way to keep my solutions
to these daily problems. The problems for each year are not released until after the whole advent
is complete, and all problems are out for at least 24 hours.

Happy coding.
